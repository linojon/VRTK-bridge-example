# VRTK with BridgeXR

## Introduction

> This project shows how to integrate BridgeXR into a project running with VRTK to extend functionality to other platforms and devices.

> This project comes with five example scenes. The goal in each scene is to demonstrate the use of native GoogleVR code and the code inside of VRTK to extend the supported platforms. We want to show the ease of porting to a native SDK so that ultimately all VRTK components will be replaced with modular code. 

## Code Samples

> The project requires no code samples. <a href="shorturl.at/iqBGU"><b>BridgeXR</b></a> works with the Unity Editor so you don't have to worry about writing any code.

> In this project we use the <a href="shorturl.at/uyHSW"><b>Daydream Elements</b></a> examples to replace the VRTK interactions on Daydream. 
>><i>Keep in mind that if an SDK example does not contain a similar behaviours to a VRTK behaviour, you will will have to write your own code. Ultimately we expect users to completely replace VRTK with their own code so that it is not coupled to an SDK.</i>
